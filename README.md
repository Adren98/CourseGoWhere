Six Sense team will develop an all-in-one portal that aims to enable secondary school students to browse existing diploma courses offered by 5 polytechnics of Singapore and plan for their tertiary education. The initial release of this project will be considered complete once the website has been tested and approved for release by the Ministry of Education(MOE). Our project's long term goal is to extend its catalogue to Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and also Junior Colleges(JC) of Singapore.
